___
+ My projects
   + **Visio** (abandoned) - My first project. It was supposed to be an app that allows you to warm up your eyes, but due to some difficulties, it was shelved in a deep drawer.
   + **Memo** (in development) - App where you can specify what plans you have for the evening or for a specific date. There will be more functionality in the app in the future.
